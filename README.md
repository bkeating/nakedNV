# nakedNV

A barebones web-based imitation of [nvALT](https://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/).

[![Dependencies](https://david-dm.org/bkeating/nakedNV.svg)](https://github.com/bkeating/nakedNV)

nakedNV is a 100% genuine knockoff of the nvALT note-taking application; One of many apps inspired by [Notational Velocity](https://notational.net/). It's written in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and uses [RxDB](https://rxdb.info/) for it's offline-first/offline-only backend.

This project came about as a mental hack to overcome some technical hurdles/blockers in a much larger project of mine; [nvAux](https://nvaux.com/). It's an attempt at getting to the core of what it takes to make a great note taking app and there is no better app in my mind than nvALT to observe and celebrate.
